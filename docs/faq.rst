Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Hopefully we can answer all of your questions here if there is no relevant place in other documents.
Please do contribute additional questions you would like answered.

Why did you...
--------------

... name this "Syntrend"?
  **Syntrend** is a :term:`portmonteau` of "Synthetic" and "Trend" ("Syn-Trend") to emphasize the idea of a Synthetic generator based on a
  trend using expressions. Other names considered were:

  * "Syntropy": ("Synthetic" and "Entropy") to emphasize the Synthetic nature of data generation with variability/chaos.

... not use JSON Schema?
  It was originally intended to use it as many data sources being used to synthesize would have a matching
  JSON Schema. The challenge is using a schema definition that also provides different patterns in data
  with a schema and consuming a JSON Schema definition while supporting the many versions of JSON Schema
  in use by popular projects is challenging.
